	Generalized Hurst Exponent with exponential smoothing: Implement the algorithm and generate the output using the four input data sets (GHE_1.txt, …, GHE_4.txt)

Formulae
w_t  = w_0 exp(-t/θ) 			                                                                   [1]

ln(K_q^w (T)) = q H(q) ln(T) + S, where S is a constant term                   [2]

Algorithm to be implemented
	Read the input data set (e.g., GHE_1.txt) and obtain a vector S, i.e. an array of size 1 × 1000 
	Set  = 100 and q = 2
	For T_max = 1, …, 19 [both inclusive]
	Set T = 1000 – T_max
	Estimate w_0=  (1- exp(-α))/(1-exp(-αT)) , where  α =1/θ 
	Estimate W_t using equation (1) for t = 0, 1, …, (T – 1) [both inclusive]
	For t = 0, …, (T-1) [both inclusive]
	Obtain Nt = absolute value for S[t + T_max] – S[t]
	Obtain Dt = absolute value of S[t]
	Obtain 〖(N_t)〗^q and 〖(D_t)〗^q for q = 2
	N_avg= sum[reverse(w_t)× 〖(N_t)〗^q  ]
	D_avg= sum[reverse(w_t)× 〖(D_t)〗^q]
	K =  N_avg/D_avg 
	For J = 5, …, 19 [both inclusive]
	Select the first-J values of K and T_max. Denote this set of values as KJ and TJ, respectively
	Perform linear regression using the formula y = a + bx, where y values are ln(KJ) values, x values are ln(TJ) values, and ln denotes the natural logarithm
	Obtain b i.e., slope of the linear regression line 
	Obtain b_avg i.e., average value for b
	Return the value b_avg/q
